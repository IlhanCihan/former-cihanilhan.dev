First of all, to create a variable, a dollar sign ($) is added before the variable name in php.

Basic variable creation rules are:
- No spaces are allowed in the variable name.
- Variable names cannot start with numbers or special characters, they must start with a letter.
- Functions used by the programming language cannot be used as variable names.
- The variable name must not exceed 255 characters.
- Characters other than letters, numbers and underscores should not be used in the variable name.

Example:
 ```php
    $num = 5;
    $text = "cihanilhan.dev";
    $character = 'M';
```
