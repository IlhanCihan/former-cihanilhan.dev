 I think there are many reasons why should a developer blog and here are my reasons why I started blogging.
<br/><br/>

## To document my journey
As someone who loves code commenting I think we can find similar values in blogging.
Code commenting provides a pseudocode to help you and, more importantly, your future self, understand what is going on.
In a similar manner blogging allows you to quickly recall what you have learned.
<br/><br/>

## It is a great way to learn
I will be posting about the technologies I am learning rather than what I already know, and I feel like
trying to teach about what you are learning is the greatest way to learn.
<br/><br/>

## It was a fun project
I created this website using Next.js, and I believe it furthered my understanding of the framework

## To helping others
It is always nice to help fellow developers on their journey of learning ðŸ˜Š
